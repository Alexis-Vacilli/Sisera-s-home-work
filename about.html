        <h1>About UNILAK</h1>
        <p>UNILAK was established in 1997 through the undeterred efforts of the Federation of Adventist Parents’Associations for the Development of Education in Rwanda (FAPADER) members that were beleaguered by the scarcity and limited opportunities of students that had accomplished their secondary education to further for tertiary education.  Since then UNILAK has risen from grass to grace and from strength to a stronger institutional firm which is founded on Seventh –Day Adventist beliefs, values and practices. The University has realized a tremendous development both in the numbers of its clientele and the diverse faculties of knowledge both undergraduate and postgraduate. The institution enrolls approximately 6500 students on its active campus of Kigali,and the boarding campuses of Nyanza in the Southern Province and Rwamagana in Eastern Province of Rwanda.
